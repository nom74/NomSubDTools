# NomSubDTools

A simple Rhino plugin designed to help with the alignment of control points on SubD objects.

## Features

1) **nomSubDAlignXY**  
Aligns control points of a SubD object to a line or curve while preserving the Z-coordinate of the points. The alignment works only in the XY plane, which is very useful when the design is nearing its finish.

2) **nomSubDArrangeToCircle**  
Arranges control points into a circle. The alignment works in any plane.

## Installation

### Install in Rhino
1. Open Rhino3D.
2. Open the PackageManager (command `PackageManager`).
3. Search for **NomSubDTools** and click **Install**.
